		<h1>Extension Library</h1>

		<div md>
			Unique feature of PHPStan is the ability to define and statically check "magic" behaviour of classes - accessing properties that are not defined in the class but are created in `__get` and `__set` and invoking methods using `__call`.

			PHPStan also allows writing custom rules that take advantage of the abstract syntax tree, advanced type inference engine, PHPDoc parser, and class reflection data.

			<!-- TODO link Developing Extensions to learn how to develop your own custom extensions! -->

			Installing extensions
			-------------------------

			Users can install various PHPStan extensions to enhance the capabilities of the static analyser. Many extensions already support [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer) Composer plugin, so in order to enable an extension, it's sufficient to require it in your `composer.json`:
		</div>

		<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">composer require --dev phpstan/extension-installer && \
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan-beberlei-assert</code></pre>

		<div md>
			If you can't or don't want to use [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer), include the extension's configuration file manually in the `includes` section:
		</div>

		<pre><code class="hljs language-yaml">includes:
	- vendor/phpstan/phpstan-beberlei-assert/extension.neon</code></pre>

		<div class="bg-blue-100 border-l-4 border-blue-500 text-blue-700 p-4 mb-4" role="alert" md>
			**Why wouldn't I want to always use [phpstan/extension-installer](https://github.com/phpstan/extension-installer)?**

			It always enables all the functionality that an extension offers. If you for example want to use only some of the rules from [phpstan-strict-rules](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-strict-rules), or if you only want to use `extension.neon` (but not `rules.neon`) from [phpstan-doctrine](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan-doctrine), you can't use the extension installer plugin and must include chosen files manually.
