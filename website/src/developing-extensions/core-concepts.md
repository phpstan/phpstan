Be aware that PHPStan configuration settings are being cached. You might need to clear this cache when working on an extension in order for your phpstan instance to acknowledge your changes.

This cache is stored in the directory path used for temporary files, available through the use of `sys_get_temp_dir()`.

This cache can be cleared the `clear-result-cache` command. [Learn more Â»](/user-guide/command-line-usage#clearing-the-result-cache)

Result cache also gets disabled when running with [`--debug`](/user-guide/command-line-usage#--debug).
