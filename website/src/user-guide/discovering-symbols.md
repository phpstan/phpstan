title: Discovering Symbols
showBanner: false
---

PHPStan needs to be able to locate symbols (classes, functions, constants) used in the analysed codebase. By default, it looks for them in these two places:

* Analysed paths (files and directories) passed as [command line arguments](/user-guide/command-line-usage) and in the [configuration file](/config-reference#analysed-files).
* Composer dependencies of the analysed project

This covers most common needs.

However, there are some advanced scenarios that might require some additional configuration.

Third party code outside of Composer dependencies
---------------------------

If your project uses some code that isn't part of your Composer dependencies, but you don't wish to analyse it, you can take advantage of `scanFiles` and `scanDirectories` config options:

```yaml
parameters:
    scanFiles:
      - Foo.class.php
    scanDirectories:
      - classes
```

Relative paths in the `scanFiles` and `scanDirectories` keys are resolved based on the directory of the config file is in.

Global constants
---------------------------

As of [PHPStan 1.7.0](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/releases/tag/1.7.0) nothing special is required to analyse code with global constants.

    <summary class="text-blue-500 font-bold">Show obsolete instructions for older PHPStan versions</summary>
    
Global constants used in the analysed code need to be defined in bootstrap files.

Create a file that looks like this:

```php
<?php

define('MY_CONSTANT', 1);
```

And add it to your [configuration file](/config-reference):

```yaml
parameters:
    bootstrapFiles:
        - constants.php
```

Please note that bootstrap files will actually be executed by the PHP runtime.

Class aliases
---------------------------

This is similar to global constants above. Class aliases used in the analysed code need to be defined in bootstrap files.

Create a file that looks like this:

```php
<?php

class_alias(\Foo::class, 'Bar');
```

And add it to your [configuration file](/config-reference):

```yaml
parameters:
    bootstrapFiles:
        - classAliases.php
```

Please note that bootstrap files will actually be executed by the PHP runtime.

Custom autoloader
---------------------------

If you're using some other autoloader than the one in Composer, PHPStan can take advantage of it to discover files with autoloaded classes.

You can register the custom autoloader in two ways:

1) By passing the PHP file that registers the autoloader as [`--autoload-file|-a` on the command line](/user-guide/command-line-usage#--autoload-file|-a).
2) By using the `bootstrapFiles` option:

```yaml
parameters:
    bootstrapFiles:
        - my_autoloader.php
```

Please note that the file with the autoloader will actually be executed by the PHP runtime.

PHPUnit as a PHAR
---------------------------

When you install [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) with [Phive](https://github.com/phar-io/phive), you might encounter similar errors when analysing your tests with PHPStan:

* Class `App\MyTest` extends unknown class `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase`.
* Call to an undefined static method `App\MyTest::assertIsArray()`.

That's because PHPStan does not see PHPUnit classes from inside `phpunit.phar`.

The way to fix it is to put `phpunit.phar` in `bootstrapFiles` in your [configuration file](/config-reference):

```yaml
parameters:
    bootstrapFiles:
        - tools/phpunit.phar
```
