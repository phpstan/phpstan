*When developing an application, our aim as software developers is to make sure it does what it ought to do and to keep the number of defects as low as possible. We should also strive to make our lives easier, to counter external circumstances like tight deadlines and ever-changing requirements causing the exact opposite. That’s why we’re always looking out for tools and practices to help us with our jobs. In this article, I’d like to introduce you to the concept of type safety and how it can improve the reliability and stability of your code.*

I wrote an article for the [April issue](https://www.phparch.com/magazine/2018-2/april/) of php[architect] magazine and it's about **reaching maximum potential** with PHPStan. You're in luck — my article was selected as the sample one for this issue so you can [**read it even without a subscription**](https://www.phparch.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/testing-strategy-phparchitect-april-2018.pdf). Give it a go — I'm really happy about how it turned out.
