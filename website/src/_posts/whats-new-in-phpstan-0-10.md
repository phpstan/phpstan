Two months ago, days before the anticipated release of PHPStan 0.10, I talked about it at PHP Prague, a small conference put together by local PHP enthusiasts.

Watch this ðŸ•—15-minute video about the latest features that weâ€™ve added to PHPStan: ðŸ‘‡

You can also check out [comprehensive release notes](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/releases/tag/0.10), although I go into a little bit more detail in the video and itâ€™s also easier to digest. Since PHPStan 0.10 was released on June 24th, there has been three point releases:

- [PHPStan 0.10.1](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/releases/tag/0.10.1) on July 1st
- [PHPStan 0.10.2](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/releases/tag/0.10.2) on July 22nd
- [PHPStan 0.10.3](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan/releases/tag/0.10.3) on August 12th

I plan to stay in the 0.10.x range for at least a few more releases because itâ€™s very stable and promising. But Iâ€™ve got a lot of ideas for the future of PHPStan planned and also some great news to share a little bit later this year! Stay tuned!
